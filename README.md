A small example webapp implemented using my [httpserver](https://github.com/Johan-S/httpserver) framework. It also uses some of my [utility](https://github.com/Johan-S/util) classes. 

A live version of this can be found [here](https://mighty-everglades-1636.herokuapp.com/). The exact project deployed can be found [here](https://github.com/Johan-S/herokuapp).

Note: These projects are just for fun and should not be used in any production environment!!!
